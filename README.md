## DATA WILL BE WIPED SO MAKE A BACKUP

1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://gingkapls/sdm636_unlock` 
2. cd into `./sdm636_unlock/unlock`
3. Reboot your phone into fastboot mode by holding down volume up + power on at the same time or alternatively, when the device is powered off.
4. Connect it to your computer and run `./unlock.sh`.
5. Done (probably).

> **Note:** If `./unlock.sh` gets stuck without output for more than 30 seconds, then there is a configuration issue. Try connecting plugging the phone into a different usb port, preferably USB 2.0.
